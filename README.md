To run, you need to have nodeJS installed and then in command line run "node www.js" which is the file in my bin folder. 
For SQL server, you need to have a local instance running by installing mySQL server and ensure you make a note of which port it is running on and then change it in the ConnectionConfig file within the mysql node module. You also need to have a database created with the correct information and you can do that using the script and running it in a workbench like the one mySQL provide.
